In this proje3ct, you'll get that language translation.Language translator is a program that is used to translate text into multiple languages like English, Hindi, Spanish, etc. In my language translator app, users can easily translate text into different languages, copy translated text, and convert text to speech. It is similar to Google Translate.
 I used a free API to convert user-entered text into different languages.This API is used only to convert text into other languages. Other things such as copying translated text and converting text to speech are done with JavaScript.
